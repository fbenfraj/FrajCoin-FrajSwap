# `FrajCoin & FrajSwap: ERC20 token and Decentralized Exchange`

FrajCoin is an ERC-20 token and FrajSwap is a decentralized exchange.
They are both build with Solidity and the contracts are deployed on the Rinkeby Network (Ethereum testnet).
Use the Rinkeby Authenticated Faucet or the Chainlink Rinkeby Faucet to get Ethereum for freeðŸ˜‰ (they are of course worth nothing)
You can use the widgets on the webapp to buy FrajCoins with ETH or sell them to get ETH back.

This project is for demonstration purpose only.
